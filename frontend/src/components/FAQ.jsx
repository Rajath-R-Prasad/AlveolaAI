const FAQS = [
  {
    q: "How is pneumonia different from a regular cold or flu?",
    a: "Colds and flu primarily affect the upper respiratory tract. Pneumonia infects the lung tissue itself — alveoli fill with fluid and pus, directly impairing oxygen exchange. This is significantly more dangerous, especially in children under 5.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can the AI replace my doctor's diagnosis?",
    a: "No. AlveolaAI is a clinical decision-support tool — a second reader. It helps radiologists and clinicians catch subtle opacities faster and more consistently. All results require review by a qualified healthcare professional before any treatment decision is made.",
  },
  {
    q: "What type of X-ray does the system need?",
    a: "Standard chest radiographs in PA (posterior-anterior) or AP (anterior-posterior) view. DICOM, JPEG, and PNG formats are accepted. The model was trained on the RSNA Pneumonia Detection dataset.",
  },
  {
    q: "How accurate is the AI detection?",
    a: "Comparable CNN-based models achieve 98–99% classification accuracy on RSNA benchmarks. Our YOLOv8-based detector adds bounding box localisation, which classification-only models lack. Real-world accuracy depends on image quality and patient demographics.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is patient data stored on your servers?",
    a: "No. Images and metadata are processed in memory and immediately discarded after analysis. The only persistent data is an anonymised result token for PDF retrieval, which expires in 24 hours.",
  },
  {
    q: "Why is early detection specifically important for children?",
    a: "Children's lung and immune systems are still maturing. Pneumonia progresses faster in young children — from mild symptoms to respiratory failure in hours. Faint ground-glass opacities visible on X-ray often precede clinical deterioration by 6–12 hours.",
  },
